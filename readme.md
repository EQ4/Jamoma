This project is the master project for the Jamoma platform.

It is intended to contain sub-projects representing the various modules of the Jamoma platform.

[Core](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore) | [Dependencies](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaDependencies) |  [Documentation](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaDoc) |  [Modular](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaModular) | [Test](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaTest) | [User Libraries](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaUserLibraries)

## Developing

The Tools folder Contains scripts which perform various essential tasks for the development of Jamoma.

Assuming you have installed 
 - [Git](http://redmine.jamoma.org/projects/jamoma/wiki/Installing_and_setting_up_GIT) 
 - [Ruby](http://ruby.about.com/od/tutorials/a/installruby.htm)
 - Cygwin ( for windows users )

````bash
  cd Jamoma/Tools
  ruby update.rb
````

Building:

````bash
  cd Jamoma/Tools
  ruby build.rb Deployment clean
````

Alternatively, if you want a developer release rather than a nice, clean release version, you may do it so with the following command:
````bash
  ruby build.rb Development
````

Assuming no error, you now have Jamoma framework compiled, installed and running. 

Welcome to the Jamoma development!

In case of errors, please take a look at the wiki: [Pitfalls_for_Developers](http://redmine.jamoma.org/projects/jamoma/wiki/Pitfalls_for_Developers)



## Automatically update modules and build sources

Both operations can be automated following these steps:

From Terminal or the cygwin window

````bash
  'cd Jamoma/Tools'
  ruby all.rb master Deployment clean install
````

Again, if you want a developer release rather than a nice, clean release version, you may do it so with the following command:
````bash
  ruby all.rb master Development clean
````

You have the latest version Jamoma repository !



## Making an installer

To generate a Mac installer.

 - do a clean deployment build as explained above
 - all zips should be unzipped including 3rd-party externs

From the terminal window:
````bash
  ruby installer.rb
````

You should find the Jamoma installer in the "Jamoma/Installers" folder.

## Setting up updated tests

To run the automated tests, you must have rosc installed.  This is a library that implements OSC support for Ruby.
The version we are using is included in the Tools/rosc folder.  To install it:
1. cd to the Tools/rosc folder
2. sudo ruby setup.rb

Now you are ready to run automated tests, as described below.



## Running automated tests

Automated tests are started by running the following script (after cd'ing into the Tools folder)
	./testrunner.rb

This relies on the 'test-components' folder in the Jamoma/library folder.
The test components need to be in that location, because they need to be in Max's searchpath.

The tests themselves are located in the 'Tests' folder at the top level of the branch, and all subfolders.
The script also looks in every folder of the Modules folder so that module tests can be kept together with the module.




## Debugging external on the Mac plataform

The Max Runtime does not use the Max5 file preferences. The AddJamomaPath.maxpat is a handy utility for temporarily adding the Jamoma folder and all subfolders to the search path so that externals, components, algorithms modules and help files can be accessed in Max Runtime, e.g. when running the debugger and Max Runtime in Xcode on the OSX platform.
