#Jamoma

The Jamoma Platform consists of a dynamic and reflexive C++ runtime library with an emphasis on audio and media as well as several implementations built on this library.  The implementations include modular environments for **Max** by [Cycling '74](http://cycling74.com) and **Pd** by [Miller Puckette](http://msp.ucsd.edu/).

**This repository is a historical relic**.  Perhaps you are probably looking for one of the following:

* [JamomaCore](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaCore) : A set of layered C++ frameworks and extensions for creating an object model. This object model is then further specialized for advanced purposes such as audio.
* [JamomaMax](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaMax) : An implementation of a modular environment for Max. This  is by far the most complete and elaborated of the Jamoma implementations.
* [JamomaPureData](https://github.com/jamoma/JamomaPureData) : An implementation of a modular environment for PureData.
